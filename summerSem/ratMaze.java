    create a solution matrix initialliy filled with 0's
    create a recursive function which takes initial matrix output matrix and position rat[i,j]
    if the position is out of the matrix or the position is not valid then return 
    markt he position output [i][j] as 1 and check if the current position is estination or not if destinaiton is reached print the output materix and return .
    recursively call for porition [i+1,j] and [i,j+1]
    unmark position [i,j], ie output [i][j]=0
